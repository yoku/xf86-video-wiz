= Introduction

This is graphics driver for the WIZ game console

= Building

== Dependencies

You will need the following X development dependencies installed on your
development system before building this package:

xorg-server > 1.4, xproto, fontsproto, renderproto

== Configuration

Type ./autogen.sh at the command line to automatically generate the
confguration system.

If you need to change some parameters to the configure  script (such as
prefix paths), you can re-run configure again after the autogen.sh
script has completed.  Make sure that you specify the correct host and
build targets for your cross compiler.  Here is an example:

./configure --build=x86_64-linux --host=arm-linux-gnueabi --target=arm-linux-gnueabi --prefix=/usr/local/toolchain/arm/arm-linux-gnueabi/

This will configure the system to use the 'arm-linux-gnueabi-gcc' compiler.

== Building

After the driver has been configured, it can be built by typing 'make' at
the command line.

= Using the driver

After building, the driver is located at
src/.libs/wiz_drv.so

This can be copied diretly to your target.  All X video drivers are located
in 'usr/lib/xorg/modules/drivers' on target.  Copy the .so there.

To use the driver, you need to configure it in /etc/X11/xorg.conf.
Add the  following section to your xorg.conf file:

Section "Device"
   Identifier    "WIZ"
   Driver        "wiz"
   Option        "fb"      "/dev/fb0"
#  Option        "NoAccel" "true"
EndSection

To change which framebuffer device you want to use, modify the "fb"
option to point at the device file you want to run on.

To disable accelerations, set the "NoAccel" option to true.

Next, you need to add the "WIZ" device to the screen:

Section "Screen"
...
Device        "WIZ"
EndSection

You do not need to configure a monitor or a mode size -the mode size is
determined automatically and cannot be changed.

Finally, restart X.
